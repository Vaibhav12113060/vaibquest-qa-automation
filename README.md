### Key Directories & Files

- **`/tests/Automation/authentication/`**: Contains the core test scripts for `login`, `registration`, and `authorization` features.
- **`/Evidence/`**: Stores all project documentation and visual proof, including test reports and setup guides.
- **`ManualTestCases.md`**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the manual test cases that form the basis for the automation scripts.
- **`playwright.config.js`**: Configures browsers, test execution settings, and reporters.
- **`.env`**: A crucial file for storing environment-specific variables like test user credentials. It is excluded from version control for security.

### JWT Tampering Test (Token Validation)

This report illustrates the security test case for validating JWT integrity. It shows the steps to log in, tamper with the token in local storage, and verify that the application forces a logout upon detecting the invalid token.
